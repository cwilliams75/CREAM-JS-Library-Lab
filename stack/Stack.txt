Stack 
A stack is an ordered collection of items that follow the last in first out principle. It is only open at one end which means the items are inserted and deleted at one end called top of the stack . This means that the newest elements are at the top and the oldest elements are at the bottom. The three main operations that can be performed on stacks are inserting an item into the stack (push), deleting an item from the stack (pop), and displaying the contents of the stack (peek or top). 
Advantages of this data structure are that it allows you to control how memory is distributed, it is not easily corrupted and helps you manage data in LIFO order. 
Disadvantages of this database is that stack memory is limited and that variable storage will be overwritten which sometimes leads to undefined behavior of the function or program.
