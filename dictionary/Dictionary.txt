Dictionary
A dictionary is a general-purpose data structure for storing a group of objects. Dictionaries have a collection of key and value pairs. When presented with a key the dictionary will return the associated value. Main operations of dictionaries are retrieving a value, updating a value, removing a key-value pair and testing for existence of a key. 
Advantages of this data structure are that it is well structured, clear, and provides good documentation for each object. 
Disadvantages of this data structure is that it is time consuming to create, it does not provide functional details, and it is not acceptable to many nontechnical users.
