Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array. Each element is a separate object and links to the next object in that list. The first node is called the head and the last node on the list points to null. 
The main advantage of using linked lists is that nodes can be added or removed easily. 
Even though we can add nodes without reorganizing the entire data structure it still has many disadvantages. 
The disadvantages include using more memory than arrays because of the storage of the pointers and that search operations are slow due to nodes being accessed sequentially.
